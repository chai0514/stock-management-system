# stock-management-system
This project is a Stock Management System (SMS) developed in Java using Eclipse IDE. The SMS helps manage inventory for a shop that sells refrigerators and TVs. Users can add, view, update stock levels, and discontinue products. The system also generates user IDs and maintains a user-friendly interface for efficient stock management.
